// HINT:
// You can get the Nth character, or letter, from a string by writing "string"[N].
// The returned value will be a string containing only one character (for example, "b").
// The first character has position 0, which causes the last one to be found at position string.length - 1.
// In other words, a two-character string has length 2, and its characters have positions 0 and 1.

// Q1
// Write a function counts Bs that takes a string as its only argument
// and returns a number that indicates how many uppercase “B”
// characters there are in the string.

function countBs(str) {
  let bCount = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {
    if (str[i] === "B") {
      bCount++;
    }
  }
  return bCount;
}

console.log("Q1: ", countBs("BananaBabyBubbles"));
